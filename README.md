# Weight Tracker

Simple weight tracker written with Angular with Firebase.

# Motivation

There simply wasn't any one tool that would satisfy my  needs of logging weights, charting them, setting goals, sending notifications, syncing with google fit and performing simple projections.

# Roadmap

I made a trello board for the project with rudimentary story descriptions and feature ideas. [You can check it out right here.](https://trello.com/b/JZ8PZHcY/weight-monitor)
